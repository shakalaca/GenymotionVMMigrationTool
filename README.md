Migrate data from old VM to new one


### Why 

In most case update of [Genymotion](http://www.genymotion.com/) includes newer VM file, and you'll got a 
warning message telling you that you won't be able to enjoy new featues while 
running older VM after upgrade. Since there's no way upgrading the older VM 
to newest version, all you can do is creating a new VM and re-install the 
android applcations.

The pain is over. 


### How

To migrate data from old VM to new one:
```
  gvm_upgrade.sh <old_vm_name> <new_vm_name>
```
